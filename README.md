# Analysis-of-Andriod-App-Market-on-Google-Play-
A project which shows analysis of Andriod App Market on Google Play
Mobile apps are everywhere, and making them is both easy and potentially profitable. Because of this, lots of new apps are being created all the time. In this project, you'll analyze over ten thousand Android apps from Google Play to find useful patterns and ideas to help apps grow and keep users engaged.

The data was collected from Google Play, and it’s not as easy to get as data from the Apple App Store. Here’s what you have:

- **apps.csv**: This file has detailed info about each app, including 13 different features.
- **user_reviews.csv**: This file contains 100 reviews for each app, showing the most helpful ones first. The reviews are pre-processed and include extra details like sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) and sentiment scores.
